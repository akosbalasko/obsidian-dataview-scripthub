          <p>I&#x2019;m not an expert in Dataview (far from that, a very, very newbie)&#x2026;<br>
My first observation is: why you create a field (&#x201C;created&#x201D;) if this data is an &#x201C;Implicit Field&#x201D;?<br>
I.e., as you can read in the <a href="https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/docs/where-data-comes-from" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">plugin documentation</a>, there&#x2019;re some metadata implicit to each file: name, size, created date, last modified date, etc.<br>
In your case, if you are interested in the day that you create the notes, then you just need to query the <code>file.cday</code> implicit metadata and forget the frontmatter entry.<br>
Try this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">```dataview
LIST
FROM &quot;&quot;
WHERE file.cday = date(&quot;2021-06-24&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to define your own field for created date, then you need to have some attention with the way that the plugin reads the format for date. In that case, I think you need to do this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">```dataview
LIST
FROM &quot;&quot;
WHERE created = date(&quot;2021-06-24&quot;)
</code></pre>
