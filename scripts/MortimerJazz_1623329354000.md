          <p>Afternoon all - just a quick question from a relative noobie to Dataview that I was hoping someone might be able to help with.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve started fairly simple by creating an MOC for podcasts that I listen to. Just a simple:</p>
<pre><code>```dataview
table author
from #podcasts 
</code></pre>
<p>That brings up the information nicely. However, in my head, clicking the name of the podcast would take me through to the page for it that already exists in my vault. Only it doesn&#x2019;t, it creates a new (blank) page for me.</p>
<p>Is there a way, where I can re-direct the click through to the page that already exists rather than creating a new one?</p>
<p>Thanks alot for your help in advance!</p>
