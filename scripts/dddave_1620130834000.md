          <p>Sorry for the multi-post/deletion.</p>
<pre><code>### Birthdays Today
```dataview
table phone as Phone, email as Email, file.mtime as LastEdit
from &quot;&quot;
where contains(birthday, &quot;05.04&quot;)
```
</code></pre>
<p>You might need to play with some formatting on the date. That&#x2019;s today&#x2019;s date so <code>MM.DD</code>.</p>
