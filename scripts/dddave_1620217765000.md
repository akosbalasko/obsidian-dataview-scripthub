          <p>For troubleshooting, here is what my frontmatter looks like on a person</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">---
aliases: [&quot;xxx&quot;]
created: [&quot;2021.03.02 10:17 AM&quot;]
birthday: 2021.04.30
email: &quot;xxx&quot;
phone: &quot;xxx&quot;
---
</code></pre>
<p>And here is my dataview codeblock</p>
<pre><code>### Birthdays Today
```dataview
table phone as Phone, email as Email, file.mtime as LastEdit
from &quot;&quot;
where contains(birthday, &quot;04.30&quot;)
```
</code></pre>
<p>See if you can get the combination of those two working.</p>
