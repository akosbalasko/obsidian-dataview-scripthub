          <p>EDIT:</p>
<p>&#x201C;econtains&#x201D; is the wrong operator. This query works:</p>
<pre><code>```dataview
LIST
WHERE contains(company,&quot;Disney&quot;)
```
</code></pre>
<p>====================</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve seen several examples on here of using the WHERE clause in interesting ways but none seem to address my use case. I&#x2019;d like to use a WHERE LIKE style phrase. I understand that the closest to a &#x201C;LIKE&#x201D; operator is the &#x201C;contains&#x201D; clause in Dataview.</p>
<p>Use Case follows.</p>
<p>I use meta fields to create a lite CRM in Obsidian.</p>
<p>I have &#x201C;company&#x201D; notes spread across multiple folders in Obsidian. When I create a note for a person I will add a YAML field for &#x201C;company&#x201D; and use internal linking to insert the company name property.</p>
<p>I have a field for &#x201C;company&#x201D; that looks like this for each &#x201C;person&#x201D; note:</p>
<pre><code>---
company: [[Notes/Disney]]
date: 2021-09-03
tags: contact
---
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x2019;d like to use Dataview to display all notes with the company &#x201C;Disney&#x201D; meta field. I don&#x2019;t want to worry about the folder that the &#x201C;Disney&#x201D; note is in. I&#x2019;ve tried variations of this Dataview query but they all fail:</p>
<pre><code>```dataview
LIST
WHERE econtains(company,&quot;Disney&quot;)
```
</code></pre>
<p>I get zero result for the above query</p>
