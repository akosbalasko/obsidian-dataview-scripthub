          <p>I also use the following on my &#x201C;Index&#x201D; (kind of a start page) to show recently edited and recently created files (excluding the Index file itself):</p>
<pre><code>```dataview
TABLE file.mtime as Edited
FROM &quot;&quot;
WHERE date(now) - file.mtime &lt;= dur(3 days) and file.name != &quot;Index.md&quot;
SORT file.mtime desc
```

```dataview
TABLE file.ctime as Created
FROM &quot;&quot;
WHERE date(now) - file.ctime &lt;= dur(3 days)
SORT file.ctime desc
```
```
</code></pre>
<p>Probably this will be more useful later, when live updating is added (it is on the roadmap on GitHub, if I&#x2019;m right).</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know who posted something like this first on the Discord, maybe it was <a class="mention" href="/u/skepticmystic">@SkepticMystic</a>? <img src="https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: There was a bug before version 0.1.8 that required to write <code>&gt;=</code> instead of <code>&lt;=</code> in the examples above. I now adjusted it to work in 0.1.8 and later.</p>
