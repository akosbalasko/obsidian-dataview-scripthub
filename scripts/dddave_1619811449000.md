          <p>For a simpler version of the birthday list, add the following to your daily note template. Adjust for date formatting and additional data to include</p>
<pre><code>### Birthdays Today
```dataview
table phone as Phone, email as Email
from &quot;&quot;
where contains(birthday, &quot;&lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;MM.DD&quot;, 0, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY.MM.DD&quot;) %&gt;&quot;)
```
</code></pre>
<p>Note: <a class="mention" href="/u/moonbase59">@Moonbase59</a>&#x2019;s code is much more robust and will show upcoming birthdays. A much better solution than mine. The above will only show <em>today&#x2019;s</em> birthdays. I just opted for this because I couldn&#x2019;t get his working and this is good enough until we get some date calculations, as <a class="mention" href="/u/moonbase59">@Moonbase59</a> linked above.</p>
<p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/moonbase59">@Moonbase59</a> for both!</p>
