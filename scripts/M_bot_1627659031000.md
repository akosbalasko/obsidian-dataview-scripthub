          <p>Since 0.4.0, <code>econtains</code> or &#x201C;exact contains&#x201D; allows you to look for exact matches only rather than substrings. There isn&#x2019;t documentation on it quite yet but the following should hopefully work</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">```dataview
TABLE Season
WHERE econtains(School, &quot;FHS&quot;)
```
</code></pre>
