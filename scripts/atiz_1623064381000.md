          <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/jmm">@jmm</a>, I think I chose a slightly different approach to this.<br>
Instead of putting the abstract in its own section, I put it in an inline field under the title, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">abstract:: here goes the abstract/summary of the paper
</code></pre>
<p>The advantage is that since it&#x2019;s an inline field, you can invoke it very easily from dataview; my table looks like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">```dataview
table abstract as Abstract
from #project
sort author asc
</code></pre>
<p>The disadvantage is what&#x2019;s above: seems like the default line length for the dataview table is capped at 500 characters. The good news is that that seems to be modifiable (per <a class="mention" href="/u/surjaa">@Surjaa</a>&#x2019;s link to the discord thread; you can edit the plugin and increase this size, although will have to do it every time it updates. I haven&#x2019;t experimented with this yet, so this is just based on the discord thread).</p>
<p>I like your approach too, but I&#x2019;m really not very fluent in dataview yet so would have to experiment to see how transclusions work in it if they do.</p>
