          <p>Let&#x2019;s say I created a custom YAML field (called Type) that I used for some notes only.</p>
<p>I want to see on which notes I have filled that YAML field and the value of the field respectively.</p>
<p>I used this:</p>
<pre><code>    ```dataview
    table Type
    sort file.name desc
    ```
</code></pre>
<p>but this returns all notes and it&#x2019;s a huge list (with only a few notes having the field &#x201C;Type&#x201D; has a value). I just want to see these notes that the &#x201C;Type&#x201D; field has a value.</p>
<p>Any ideas how to setup the query?</p>
